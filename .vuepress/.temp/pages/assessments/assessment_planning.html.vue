<p>an academic report</p>
<p>The practical outcomes for this unit is to create a fully responsive single page web-application supporting students in their university experience. This assessment represent the planning portion of the overall project.  This report represents an attempt to get to the very essence of what students are trying to their day-to-day university lives - specfically, you are trying to find out in what way these students are underservered. You will need to find out what this audience are really intending to achieve in their every day university experiences.</p>

<li>Introduction - should provide a background to the problem that you are addressing, your approach to exploring this problem and the outcomes and suggestions based of this exploration</li>
<li>Methods - methods are key, and they represent the tools you used to explore your chosen demographic. This section will include the follwoing:
<ol>
<li>A summary of the overarching methodology that you are using to conduct this phase of the project. I reccomend using <a href="https://jobs-to-be-done-book.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jobs To be Done<OutboundLink/></a> or the <a href="https://www.gv.com/sprint/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Design Sptiny<OutboundLink/></a>. Regardless of the methdology that you choose you will need to adapt it to fit your project scope and time scale</li>
<li>Tools (e.g. surveys, focus groups, observations, contextual research) that you used to gather data from potential users</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Discussion/Results - Presents you finding from methods you employed. This will vary dependign of the methodoligy, as each will require you to explore different areas. Suggenst how you can meet the un-met needs</li>
<li>Conclution - overching findings, you should also take the oppertunity to critiquie the your chosen methdology</li>
<li>Appendices - Should include the following:
<ul>
<li>Ethical clearance for the project</li>
<li>Rough prototypes (e.g. wire frames)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Students are to deliver a single page web application to support students in their university experience. There are two possible assessment</p>
<p>We must gain a deep understanding of what students are trying to accomplish?</p>
<p>What are the unmet needs?</p>
<ul>
<li>Gathering needs</li>
<li>ethnographic, contextual, and observational research methods in addition to interviewing techniques such as voice of the customer (VOC), lead user analysis, and storytelling.</li>
</ul>
<p>&quot;Jobs-to-be-Done Theory provides a framework for (i) categorizing, defining, capturing, and organizing all your customer’s needs, and (ii) tying customer- defined performance metrics (in the form of desired outcome statements) to the job-to-be-done.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;
Harvard Business School marketing professor Theodore Levitt said, &quot;People don't want to buy a quarter-inch drill. They want a quarter-inch hole!&quot; Clayton Christensen said, “People buy products and services to get a job done.” In his most recent book he says, “Customers don’t buy products; they pull them into their life to make progress.”
&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;innovation more of an art than a science.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;
While nearly every manager agrees that the goal of innovation is to devise solutions that address unmet customer needs, a common language for communicating a need does not exist.&quot; (p.41)</p>
<p>&quot;Despite the available needs-gathering methods, companies nearly always fail to uncover all or even most of the customer’s needs.&quot;
(p.41)</p>
<p>&quot;In the September, 2016 Harvard Business Review article, “Know Your Customers’ Jobs to be Done,” Clayton Christensen states, “Innovation can be far more predictable—and far more profitable—if you start by identifying the jobs that customers are struggling to get done.” (p.20)</p>
<p>&quot;The goal of innovation is straightforward: to come up with solutions that address unmet customer needs. &quot; (p30)
&quot;As I will explain, the “ideas-first” approach is inherently flawed&quot;
Ideas first vs needs first</p>
<p>Chapter 2 introduces the solution: the Jobs-to-be-Done Needs Framework.</p>
<p>This structural flaw in the needs- first approach is corrected in the Outcome-Driven Innovation process.</p>
<p>&quot;
In what I call the “ideas-first” approach, companies brainstorm or otherwise come up with product or service ideas and then test them with customers to see how well the ideas address the customer’s needs. In the “needs-first” approach, companies first learn what the customer’s needs are, then discover which needs are unmet, and then devise a solution that addresses those unmet needs.&quot;  (p30)</p>

</ul>
<p>people “hire” products to get a “job” done (p18)</p>
<p>&quot;Clay was quick to key in on the fact that the focus of our approach was not on the customer or the product, but rather on the underlying process the customer was trying to execute, or, as he eventually came to call it, the “job” the customer was trying to get done.&quot; (p18)</p>
<p>&quot;Tying customer-defined metrics to the underlying process the customer was trying to execute was the key to success.&quot;</p>
<p>The purpose of this first assessment is to prototype and document your proposed solution for your student experience web application. You are required to get to the very essence of</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>identify the metrics that customers use to judge the value  -   (Outcome-Driven Innovation</p>

<p>The solution should be a modern single-page web application (SPA).</p>
<ul>
<li>The web application should be functional, including features such as - Authentication - Data persistence</li>
<li>You will validate your work through unit/functional testing</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="design-focused" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#design-focused" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Design Focused</h3>
<p>This solution is focused more on validating a prototype. You should be focused on how data should be presented, rather than manipulating data.</p>
<ul>
<li>The web application should be functional, however, there will be less functionality than the development focused route. To achieve this:
<ul>
<li>You may use mock place holder data</li>
<li>Special consideration should be given to granular design choices</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You will need to validate your solution through testing with a representative sample of users. Feedback should be systematically gathered and analysed from your user sample</li>
